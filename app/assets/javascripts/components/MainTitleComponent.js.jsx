          	keep Austin weird?
         It’s insulting and we need a new slogan.  
Why call us weird?
why call us uncanny, 
                           eerie,
                                              unnatural, 
                    unearthly, 
                                             ghostly, 
                strange, 
                                       abnormal, unusual, or WEIRD?
Because we like live music?
Because we demand better tasting and healthier food?
Because we encourage creative expression?
Because we’re not ignorant judgemental purveyors of hate and intolerance?
That’s not weird.  It’s just better.  It’s a better way of life.
So we need a new slogan.  A slogan that truly represents the spirit of this city.
